<h1 class="topictitle1">Hints and Tips for the Classic Express Launchpad Template</h1>
<div><p>The Classic Express Launchpad Template provides you with a starting point
for creating a setup launchpad that you can use with Express branded products.</p>
<p> This template has code that you can use to start a product's installation
program, display documentation, and provide localized content.</p>
<p>Things to note about the Classic Express Launchpad Template:</p>
<ul><li>All commands and programs used are defined in launchpadContent/global.properties.</li>
<li>The sample applications are included on DISK1 in the Disk Layout page.
To add custom installation programs or applications, define the application
in launchpadContent\global.properties (following the examples for the sample
applications). Import the applications to the appropriate disk in the project
using the controls found on the disk layout tab.</li>
<li>All HTML files use the same stylesheet (content.css) which resides in
the launchpadContent directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Classic Express Launchpad Template contains the following pages:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Welcome</strong> - The welcome page typically provides an overview of the
product and an explanation of the features of the launchpad.  The welcome
page should be concise, yet offer the user options for finding more information
about the product by offering a link to the product Web site that is displayed
in a new browser window. The welcome page features code to bring up an external
Web site in a browser.  Use the <samp class="codeph">viewPage()</samp> function to display
new windows instead of JavaScript's <samp class="codeph">window.open()</samp> because <samp class="codeph">window.open()</samp> is more likely to be blocked by a popup blocker.</li>
<li><strong>Release Information</strong> - The release information page typically provides
information that is specific to a unique release of a product.  For example,
installation concerns, changes in prerequisites, major features or fixes that
have been addressed in the release, and similar content is appropriate for
a release information page.  The release information page features code to
view a PDF and run an application.</li>
<li><strong>Prerequisite Information</strong> - The prerequisites page typically provides
a control for running a prerequisites verification program that determines
if system prerequisites exist on the computer, and returns a list of any prerequisites
that it does not detect.  The prerequisite information page features code
to view a PDF and run an application.</li>
<li><strong>Installation Scenario</strong> - Installation scenarios content typically
provides the various approaches to installing a product that a user can take.
Users can choose a specific installation scenario based on the way that he
or she intends to use the product.  This content explains the differences
in various installation scenarios that a user can choose, and provides information
about why a user would choose one installation scenario over any other.  Not
every product features installation scenarios.  If you are customizing the
Classic Express Launchpad Template for such a product, you can remove this
section from the navigation. The installation scenarios page features code
to run a custom program with an argument.</li>
<li><strong>Migration Information</strong> - Migration content typically explains a
migration path that a user needs to take to upgrade from an earlier version
of a product to a newer one. If migration information is not relevant to a
specific product, this content should be removed from the navigation. The
migration information page features code to view a PDF and run an application.</li>
<li><strong>Install</strong> - The product installation page typically provides a control
for initiating a product installation. You can add multiple product installation
pages to a setup launchpad to support the installations of multiple products.
The installation page features code to start a product installation.</li>
<li><strong>Exit</strong> - The exit link on the navigation menu exits the launchpad.</li>
</ul>
