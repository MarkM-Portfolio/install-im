claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that

contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a

third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>

assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on style 
sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM 
is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific 
dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of 
"use". See the older formulation for the policy prior to this 
date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about 
using materials from our site, such as the translating or

theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>

offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent

may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You

for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability. <br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a 
host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". 
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment 
of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open

<br>
Subject to any third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. 
("SGI") hereby grants permission to Recipient (defined below), 
under Recipient's copyrights in the Original Software (defined 
below), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, 
sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software (defined below), and 
to permit persons to whom the Subject Software is furnished in 
accordance with this License to do the same, subject to all of the 
following terms and conditions, which Recipient accepts by engaging 
in any such use, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, 
distributing, sublicensing or selling:<br>
<br>
1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
    (a) "Original Software" means source code of computer 
software code which is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.<br>
<br>
    (b) "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion 
from the substance or structure of either the Original Software 
or any previous Modifications. When Subject Software is 
released as a series of files, a Modification means (i) any addition 
to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Original 
Software or previous Modifications and (ii) any new file that 
contains any part of the Original Code or previous Modifications.<br>
<br>
    (c) "Subject Software" means the Original Software or 
Modifications or the combination of the Original Software and 
Modifications, or portions of any of the foregoing.<br>
<br>
    (d) "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity 
exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this 
License. For legal entities, "Recipient" includes any entity which 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with 
Recipient. For purposes of this definition, "control" of an entity 
means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to direct or manage such 
entity, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

<br>
2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms. 
Redistributions of Subject Software in source code form must retain the 
notice set forth in Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of 
this License must be included in any documentation for such 
Subject Software where the recipients' rights relating to Subject 
Software are described. Recipient may distribute the source code 
version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this 
License, and (ii) the license terms include this Section 2 and 
Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of this License, which terms may 
not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such 
license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under a 
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient 
alone, not by SGI. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for 
any liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such terms 
Recipient offers.<br>
<br>
3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth 
in Exhibit A must be conspicuously included in any notice in 
an executable version of Subject Software, related 
documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the user's 
rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute 
the executable version of Subject Software under a license of 
Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms 
of this License, and (ii) the license terms include this 
Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of this License, 
which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms 
of such license. If Recipient distributes the executable 
version under a different license Recipient must make it absolutely 
clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered 
by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient hereby agrees to 
indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of any 
such terms Recipient offers.<br>
<br>
4. Termination. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if Recipient fails to comply 
with terms herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days 
of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject Software which is 
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License 
absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any 
rights to use any trade name, trademark or service mark 
whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or service mark of SGI may be used 
to endorse or promote products derived from the Subject 
Software without prior written permission of SGI.<br>
<br>
6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights 
with respect to the OpenGL API or to any software or hardware 
implementation thereof or to any other software whatsoever, nor shall any 
other rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by 
implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Subject Software. 
Title to and ownership of the Original Software at all times 
remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software not expressly 
granted under this License are reserved.<br>
<br>
7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall 
comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with 
use and distribution of the Subject Software, including but not 
limited to, all export and import control laws and regulations of 
the U.S. government and other countries. Recipient may not 
distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes (directly or 
contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret, 
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any 
other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or 
warranty, express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable 
law it might be deemed to have been distributed.<br>
<br>
8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has 
knowledge of any one or more third party claims that reproduction, 
modification, use, distribution, import or sale of Subject Software 
(including particular functionality or code incorporated in Subject 
Software) infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, 
Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing the title 
"LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the 
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of 
the Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the 
claim. Also, upon gaining such knowledge of any such claim, 
Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web page in the 
Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3, above, and in the 
text of any related documentation, license agreement or 
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to 
the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after 
it makes Subject Software available to any other person or 
entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying 
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to 
inform those who received the Subject Software that new knowledge 
has been obtained.<br>
<br>
9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON 
AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT 
THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK 
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY 
SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR 
LIABILITY FOR ANY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF 
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF 
ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS 
DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, 
SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK 
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND 
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY 
SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.<br>
<br>
11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for 
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of 
rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and 
hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, 
liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of 
reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use, 
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or 
out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.<br>
<br>
12. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a 
"commercial item" consisting of "commercial computer software" as such 
terms are defined in title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
and all U.S. Government End Users acquire only the rights set 
forth in this License and are subject to the terms of this 
License.<br>
<br>
13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete 
agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this 
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed so as to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic 
effect as the original provision and the remainder of this License 
will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the 
State of California as applied to agreements entered into and to 
be performed entirely within California between California 
residents. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the 
Northern District of California (or, absent subject matter 
jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), 
with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, 
with the losing party responsible for costs, including without 
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The 
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation 
which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed 
against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>

Modification, even if such software files are aggregated as part of a 
product, or in any medium of storage, with any file that does 
contain Original Software or any previous Modification.<br>
<br>
2. License Terms. All distribution of the Subject Software 
must be made subject to the terms of this License. A copy of

ReadMe file entitled "Important Legal Notice" must be distributed 
with each distribution of one or more files that incorporate 
Subject Software. That file must be included with distributions 
made in both source code and executable form. A copy of the 
License and the Required Notice must be included in that file. 
Recipient may distribute Accompanying Technology under a license of 
Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this

<br>
3. Termination. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if Recipient fails to comply 
with terms herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days 
of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject Software that is 
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License

contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret, 
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any 
other person or entity, or (ii) breaches any representation or 
warranty, express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable 
law it might be deemed to have been distributed.<br>
<br>
7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has 
knowledge of any one or more third party claims that reproduction, 
modification, use, distribution, import or sale of Subject Software 
(including particular functionality or code incorporated in Subject 
Software) infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, 
Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing the title 
"LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the 
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of 
the Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the 
claim. Also, upon gaining such knowledge of any such claim, 
Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web page in the 
Required Notice, and in the text of any related documentation,

reasonably calculated to provide such knowledge to those who received 
the Subject Software.<br>

part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under 
Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of 
Modifications made by that Contributor.<br>
<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
     3.1. Application of License.<br>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You 
contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including 
without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered 
Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or 
a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, 
and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of 
the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any 
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the 
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights 
hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering 
the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You 
contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms 
of this License either on the same media as an Executable 
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to 
anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if 
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must 
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it 
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a 
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made 
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that 
the Source Code version remains available even if the 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
<br>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to 
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must 
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, 
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the 
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or 
related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership 
of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 
or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and 
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a 
recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such 
knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in 
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in 
all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall 
take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of 
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that 
API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 
file.<br>
<br>
          (c)    Representations.<br>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or 
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.<br>
<br>
     3.5. Required Notices.<br>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such 
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant 
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If 
You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name 
as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You 
must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the 
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership 
rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may 
do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the 
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify 
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for 
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the 
Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the 
terms of this License, including a description of how and where 
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice 
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable 
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the 
Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license 
of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not 
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code 
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must 
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or 
any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms 
You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.7. Larger Works.<br>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You 
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
for the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms 
of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum 
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code 
they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file 
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions 
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed 
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer 
has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered 
Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
     6.1. New Versions.<br>
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may 
publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it 
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such 
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created 
under this License.<br>
<br>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
     If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which 
is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You 
must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", 
"MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly 
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that 
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make 
it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which 
differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public 
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original 
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall 
not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS 
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE 
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder 
will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms 
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which 
are properly granted shall survive any termination of this 
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against 
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 
"Participant")  alleging that:<br>
<br>
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly 
or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 
this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a 
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use 
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw 
Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version 
against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed 
upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not 
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 
and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day 
notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as 
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had 
made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br>
<br>
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor 
Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the 
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable 
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.<br>
<br>
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 
or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or 
any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive 
termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, 
THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE 
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF 
SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION 
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is 
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial 
computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," 
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire 
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning 
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to 
be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the 
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent 
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-
law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one 
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do 
business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to 
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in 
Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible 
for costs, including without limitation, court costs and 
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the 
drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each 
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You 
agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered 
Code as "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the 
Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered 
Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, 
if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file 
described in Exhibit A.<br>

 #	A large portion of the dictionary entries<br>

conditions for ICOT<br>
 #	Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.<br>
 #	<br>
 #	Each User may also freely distribute the Program, 
whether in its<br>
 #	original form or modified, to any third party or 
parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #	that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will 
ALWAYS appear<br>

otherwise<br>

 #	<br>
 #	NO WARRANTY<br>
 #	<br>
 #	The program was produced on an experimental basis in the 
course of the<br>
 #	research and development conducted during the project 
and is provided<br>
 #	to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  
Accordingly, the<br>

whether express,<br>

used herein<br>
 #	includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the 
quality,<br>

particular purpose of<br>
 #	the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or 
violation of<br>

 #	<br>
 #	Each user of the program will agree and understand, and 
be deemed to<br>

whatsoever for<br>

from or<br>

user.<br>

in connection<br>

otherwise had<br>
 #	knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any

 #	foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the

3. Time Zone Database<br>
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time 
Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ 
database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time 
Zone Database section 7.<br>
7.  Database Ownership<br>
<br>
   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an 
IETF<br>
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly 
updated work<br>
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain 
in the public<br>
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] 
do not apply<br>
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals 
make to it.<br>
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the 
TZ Database,<br>
   the organization that is providing the IANA 
Considerations defined in<br>
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the 
IETF,<br>
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all 
competent court<br>
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or 
the IETF Trust<br>
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a 
contribution to the<br>
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in 
that<br>
   contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

You agree that neither the programs nor any direct product 
thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation of 
these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these 
laws including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or

LICENSE RIGHTS <br>
We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited 
license to use the programs only for the purpose of developing, 
testing, prototyping and demonstrating your application, and not for 
any other purpose. If you use the application you develop under 
this license for any internal data processing or for any 
commercial or production purposes, or you want to use the programs for 
any purpose other than as permitted under this agreement, you 
must obtain a production release version of the program by 
contacting us or an Oracle reseller to obtain the appropriate license. 
You acknowledge that we may not produce a production release 
version of the program and any development efforts undertaken by 
you are at your own risk. We may audit your use of the 
programs. Program documentation, if available, may accessed online at 
http://otn.oracle.com/docs.<br>
Ownership and Restrictions We retain all ownership and

operating environment identified by us. You may make one copy of the 
programs for backup purposes.<br>
You may not: <br>
- use the programs for your own internal data processing or 
for any commercial or production purposes, or use the programs 
for any purpose except the development of your application;<br>
- use the application you develop with the programs for any 
internal data processing or commercial or production purposes 
without securing an appropriate license from us;<br>
- continue to develop your application after you have used 
it for any internal data processing, commercial or production 
purpose without securing an appropriate license from us, or an 
Oracle reseller;<br>
- remove or modify any program markings or any notice of 
our proprietary rights;<br>
- make the programs available in any manner to any third 
party;<br>
- use the programs to provide third party training;<br>
- assign this agreement or give or transfer the programs or 
an interest in them to another individual or entity; - cause 
or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for 
interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the programs;<br>
- disclose results of any program benchmark tests without 
our prior consent.<br>
Export<br>
You agree that U.S. export control laws and other 
applicable export and import laws govern your use of the programs, 
including technical data; additional information can be found on 
Oracle's Global Trade Compliance web site located at http://www.
oracle.com/products/export/index.html?content.html. You agree that 
neither the programs nor any direct product thereof will be 
exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or 
will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, 
without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons 
proliferation.<br>
Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies<br>
THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.<br>
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR 
LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR 
ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN 
IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT 
EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).<br>
Trial Programs Included With Orders<br>
We may include additional programs with an order which may 
be used for trial purposes only. You will have 30 days from 
the delivery date to evaluate these programs. Any use of these 
programs after the 30 day trial period requires you to obtain the 
applicable license. Programs licensed for trial purposes are provided 
"as is" and we do not provide technical support or any 
warranties for these programs.<br>
No Technical Support<br>
Our technical support organization will not provide 
technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs 
licensed under this agreement.<br>
End of Agreement<br>
You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies 
of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to 
use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of 
this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of 
the programs.<br>
Relationship Between the Parties<br>
The relationship between you and us is that of 
licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to 
assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of 
the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, 
employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this 
agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to 
independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar 
to the other party's products, so long as proprietary 
information of the other party is not included in such software.<br>
Open Source<br>
"Open Source" software - software available without charge 
for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed 
under terms that require the user to make the user's 
modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 
'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source 
code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with 
the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) 
create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the 
Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third 
party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property 
or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you 
may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and 
an Open Source program where such use results in a program file
(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the 
Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if 
the Open Source program is licensed under a license that 
requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may 
not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the 
GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could 
cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle 
program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms 
of the GPL.<br>
Entire Agreement<br>
You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for 
the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all 
prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any 
term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, 
the remaining provisions will remain effective.<br>

name) to the <br>
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>

the <br>
original version of the Work and any modifications or

copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, 
"submitted" <br>
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication sent to <br>
the Licensor or its representatives, including but not 
limited to <br>
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control <br>
systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or 
on behalf <br>
of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and

but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or 
otherwise <br>
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a 
Contribution."<br>
<br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity <br>

conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, <br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable <br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly <br>
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
Work and <br>
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a

irrevocable (except <br>
as stated in this section) patent license to make, have

by such <br>
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) <br>
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to <br>
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute 
patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>
is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>
the following conditions:<br>

prominent notices <br>
     stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works <br>
     that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, 
and <br>
     attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
     those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
     Works; and<br>
<br>
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its <br>
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that 
do not <br>
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one of <br>
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
     part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form 
or <br>
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if 
and <br>
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not <br>
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an <br>
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such <br>
     additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
     the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions.  
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

The following will be added to the notices file for 
Shrinksafe (and called out in the DOU for Dojo):<br>
<br>
The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional 
Shrinksafe build tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed 
with that tool.  Shrinksafe contains modified files from Mozilla 
Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.  The 
source code for these modifications has been made available at the 
public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.<br>
<br>
The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or 
higher in order to run.  We are relying on the separate DD 
Checklist already approved for the Rhino 1.7R2 jar. The version of 
Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe package by 
default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.<br>

 *      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
 *<br>
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
 *      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
 *<br>
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission 
to use the trade<br>
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names 
of the Licensor,<br>
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>

the NOTICE file.<br>
 *<br>
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by 
applicable law or<br>
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work

either express or<br>
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>

FITNESS FOR A<br>
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this<br>
 *      License.<br>
 *<br>
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, 
or otherwise,<br>
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as 
deliberate and grossly<br>
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a<br>
 *      result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the<br>
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
 *<br>
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may 
choose to offer,<br>
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, 
You may act only<br>
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your

<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties

grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the 
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish 
with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by 
ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into 
commerical software.<br>
<br>
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, 
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By 
"credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source 
code into one of your programs (commercial product, research 
project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in 
the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR 
and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention 
that you developed it using ANTLR. <br>
In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our 
source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to 
continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools 
available as they are completed.<br>

perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. <br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet the following conditions: <br>

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and <br>
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating that You changed the files; and <br>
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those 
notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; 
and <br>
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include 
a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within 
such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the 
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of 
the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, 
if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. <br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License. <br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and

law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and

under this License. <br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages. <br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability. <br>

claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that

<br>
    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You 
may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in

express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

<br>
The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional 
Shrinksafe build tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed 
with that tool.  Shrinksafe contains modified files from Mozilla 
Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.  The 
source code for these modifications has been made available at the 
public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.<br>
<br>
The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or 
higher in order to run.  We are relying on the separate DD 
Checklist already approved for the Rhino 1.7R2 jar. The version of 
Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe package by 
default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.<br>

claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that

notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You 
may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and

<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and

express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

<br>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF 
THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION 
OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S 
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
<br>
    DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
    "Contribution" means:<br>
<br>
        in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial 
code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
<br>
        in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
<br>
        i. changes to the Program, and<br>
<br>
        ii. additions to the Program;where such changes 
and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed 
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' 
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not 
derivative works of the Program.<br>
<br>
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that 
distributes the Program.<br>
<br>
    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a 
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its 
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in 
accordance with this Agreement.<br>
<br>
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under 
this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br>
<br>
    GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
        Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each 
Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-
free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works 
of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and 
sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such 
derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br>
<br>
        Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each 
Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-
free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, 
offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of 
such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. 
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the 
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added 
by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes 
such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The 
patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which 
include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
        Recipient understands that although each 
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, 
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program 
does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property 
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any 
liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based 
on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. 
As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted 
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure 
any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
        Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge 
it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if 
any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
    REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in 
object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br>
<br>
        it complies with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement; and<br>
<br>
        its license agreement:<br>
<br>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all 
Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, 
including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and 
implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for 
a particular purpose;<br>
<br>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all 
Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, 
special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
<br>
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from 
this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by 
any other party; and<br>
<br>
        iv) states that source code for the Program is 
available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain 
it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily 
used for software exchange.<br>
<br>
    When the Program is made available in source code form:<br>
<br>
        it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
<br>
        a copy of this Agreement must be included with each 
copy of the Program.<br>
<br>
    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright 
notices contained within the Program.<br>
<br>
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator 
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably 
allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the 
Contribution.<br>
<br>
    COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. 
While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and 
indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against 
any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third 
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by 
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in 
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to 
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged 
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified 
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in 
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to 
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the 
defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified 
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in 
a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is 
then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor 
then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to 
Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such 
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if 
a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as 
a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br>
<br>
    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE 
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is 
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated 
with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but 
not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs 
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br>
<br>
    DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, 
NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR 
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), 
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, 
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR 
THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
    GENERAL<br>
<br>
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or 
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and 
without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall 
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any 
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the 
Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's 
patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2
(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall 
terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or 
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a 
reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. 
If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon 
as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations 
under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br>
<br>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of 
this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the 
Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following 
manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new 
versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. 
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to 
modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial 
Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the 
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate 
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may 
always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of 
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute 
the Program (including its Contributions) under the new 
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, 
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property 
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by 
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not 
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br>
<br>
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of 
New York and the intellectual property laws of the United 
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal 
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of 
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any 
resulting litigation.<br>

comply with<br>
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br>
<br>
2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>
<br>
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your 
choice to<br>
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version 
of this<br>

<br>
3. Responsibilities<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>
<br>
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, 
including any<br>
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, 
must be under<br>
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that 
the Source<br>
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms 
of this<br>
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. 
You may not<br>
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the 
Source Code<br>
Form.<br>
<br>
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>
<br>
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br>
<br>
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in 
Source Code<br>
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform 
recipients of<br>
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such 
Source Code<br>
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a 
charge no more<br>
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br>
<br>
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms 
of this<br>
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, 
provided that the<br>
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to 
limit or alter<br>
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under 
this License.<br>
<br>
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>
<br>
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of 
Your choice,<br>
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this 
License for<br>
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination 
of Covered<br>
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary 
Licenses, and the<br>
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary 
Licenses, this<br>
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered 
Software<br>
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the 
recipient of<br>
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute 
the Covered<br>
Software under the terms of either this License or such 
Secondary<br>
License(s).<br>
<br>
3.4. Notices<br>
<br>
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license 
notices<br>
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers 
of warranty,<br>
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source 
Code Form of<br>
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license 
notices to<br>
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>
<br>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support,<br>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
recipients of Covered<br>
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on<br>
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear that any<br>
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation 
is offered by<br>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every 
Contributor for any<br>
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include 
additional<br>
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability 
specific to any<br>
jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms 
of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software 
due to<br>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) 
comply with<br>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; 
and (b)<br>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such 
description must<br>
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of 
the Covered<br>
Software under this License. Except to the extent 
prohibited by statute<br>
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently 
detailed for a<br>
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate 
automatically<br>
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if 
You become<br>
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from 
a particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and 
until such<br>
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, 
and (b) on an<br>
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of 
the<br>
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after You have<br>
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a 
particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such 
Contributor<br>
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable 
means, this is the<br>
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with 
this License<br>
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 
days after<br>
Your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by 
asserting a patent<br>
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a 
Contributor Version<br>
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the 
rights granted to<br>
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software 
under Section<br>
2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br>
<br>
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 
above, all<br>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and 
resellers) which<br>
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under 
this License<br>
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>

cross-claims or counter-claims.<br>
<br>

extent<br>
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation 
which provides<br>
that the language of a contract shall be construed against 
the drafter<br>

<br>
10.3. Modified Versions<br>
<br>
If you create software not governed by this License, and

by their<br>
 *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
 *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
 *      institute patent litigation against any entity

patent licenses<br>
 *      granted to You under this License for that Work

 *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices<br>
 *          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
 *<br>
 *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
 *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>

 *          the Derivative Works; and<br>
 *<br>
 *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as 
part of its<br>
 *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that 
You distribute must<br>
 *          include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained<br>
 *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those 
notices that do not<br>
 *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
at least one<br>
 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text 
file distributed<br>
 *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or<br>
 *          documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or,<br>
 *          within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and<br>
 *          wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents<br>
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational 
purposes only and<br>
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
 *          notices within Derivative Works that You 
distribute, alongside<br>
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
Work, provided<br>
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed<br>
 *          as modifying the License.<br>
 *<br>
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
 *      may provide additional or different license terms 
and conditions<br>
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided 
Your use,<br>
 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work 
otherwise complies with<br>
 *      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
 *<br>
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
 *      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
 *<br>
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission 
to use the trade<br>
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names 
of the Licensor,<br>
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>
 *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of 
the NOTICE file.<br>
 *<br>
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by 
applicable law or<br>
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work 
(and each<br>
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS 
IS" BASIS,<br>
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
either express or<br>
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A<br>
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this<br>
 *      License.<br>
 *<br>
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, 
or otherwise,<br>
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as 
deliberate and grossly<br>
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a<br>
 *      result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the<br>
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
 *<br>
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may 
choose to offer,<br>
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, 
You may act only<br>
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

<br>
The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM 
obtained under the Artistic License (source code available via the 
indicated URL):" http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html<br>
<br>
The intent of this document is to state the conditions 
under which a<br>
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder 
maintains some<br>
semblance of artistic control over the development of the 
package,<br>
while giving the users of the package the right to use and 
distribute<br>
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the 
right to make<br>
reasonable modifications.<br>
<br>
Definitions:<br>
<br>
	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by 
the<br>
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of 
files<br>
	created through textual modification.<br>
<br>
	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not 
been<br>
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the 
wishes<br>
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.<br>
<br>
	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or<br>
	copyrights for the package.<br>
<br>
	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or 
distributing<br>
	this Package.<br>
<br>
	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the<br>
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people 
involved,<br>
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the<br>
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at 
large<br>
	as a market that must bear the fee.)<br>
<br>
	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the 
item<br>
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the 
item.<br>
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute 
it<br>
	under the same conditions they received it.<br>
<br>
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source 
form of the<br>
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, 
provided that you<br>
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and 
associated disclaimers.<br>
<br>
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other 
modifications<br>
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright 
Holder.  A Package<br>
modified in such a way shall still be considered the 
Standard Version.<br>
<br>
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in 
any way, provided<br>
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file 
stating how and<br>
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at 
least ONE of the<br>
following:<br>
<br>
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or 
otherwise make them<br>
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications 
to Usenet or<br>
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a 
major archive<br>
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright 
Holder to include<br>
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the 
Package.<br>
<br>
    b) use the modified Package only within your 
corporation or organization.<br>
<br>
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do 
not conflict<br>
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, 
and provide<br>
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable 
that clearly<br>
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the 
Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in 
object code or<br>
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the 
following:<br>
<br>
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and 
library files,<br>
    together with instructions (in the manual page or 
equivalent) on where<br>
    to get the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable 
source of<br>
    the Package with your modifications.<br>
<br>
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, 
and clearly<br>
    document the differences in manual pages (or 
equivalent), together<br>
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the 
Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any 
distribution of this<br>
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of 
this<br>
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package 
itself.  However,<br>
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other 
(possibly<br>
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly 
commercial) software<br>
distribution provided that you do not advertise this 
Package as a<br>
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's 
interpreter within<br>
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be 
construed as a mere<br>
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard 
Version of the<br>
interpreter is so embedded.<br>
<br>
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or 
produced as<br>
output from the programs of this Package do not 
automatically fall<br>
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever 
generated<br>
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated 
with this<br>
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated 
with this<br>
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of 
producing a<br>
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image 
shall<br>
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor 
shall it<br>
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided 
that you do<br>
not represent such an executable image as a Standard 
Version of this<br>
Package.<br>
<br>
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in 
other<br>
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in 
order to<br>
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined 
by this<br>
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but 
are the<br>
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these 
subroutines do<br>
not change the language in any way that would cause it to 
fail the<br>
regression tests for the language.<br>
<br>
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial 
distribution is always<br>
permitted provided that the use of this Package is 
embedded; that is,<br>
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's 
interfaces visible<br>
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use 
shall not be<br>
construed as a distribution of this Package.<br>
<br>
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to 
endorse or promote<br>
products derived from this software without specific prior 
written permission.<br>

ZLIB CODE.  The Program includes the following zlib 
software:<br>
<br>
•	zlib 1.2.3<br>
<br>
IBM obtained the right to use the software under the 
following license from zlib:  <br>
<br>
<br>
zlib 1.2.3 is a general purpose data compression library.  
All the code is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib 
library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in 
the files http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), 
rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These 
documents are also available in other formats from ftp://ftp.uu.
net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html<br>
<br>
All functions of the compression library are documented in 
the file zlib.h (volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact 
zlib@gzip.org). A usage example of the library is given in the file 
example.c which also tests that the library is working correctly. 
Another example is given in the file minigzip.c. The compression 
library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and 
minigzip.c.<br>
<br>
To compile all files and run the test program, follow the 
instructions given at the top of Makefile. In short "make test; make 
install" should work for most machines. For Unix: "./configure; make 
test; make install". For MSDOS, use one of the special makefiles 
such as Makefile.msc. For VMS, use make_vms.com.<br>
<br>
Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or 
to Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL 
version. The zlib home page is http://www.zlib.org or http://www.
gzip.org/zlib/ Before reporting a problem, please check this 
site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib; 
otherwise get the latest version and check whether the problem still 
exists or not.<br>
<br>
PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.
html before asking for help.<br>
<br>
Mark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib 
for the Jan. 1997 issue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the 
article is available in http://dogma.
net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm<br>
<br>
The changes made in version 1.2.3 are documented in the 
file ChangeLog.<br>
<br>
Unsupported third party contributions are provided in 
directory "contrib".<br>
<br>
A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java 
Development Kit http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2
/docs/api/java/util/zip/package-summary.html See the zlib home page http://www.zlib.org for 
details.<br>
<br>
A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess 
<pmqs@cpan.org> is in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) 
sites http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Compress/<br>
<br>
A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling 
<amk@amk.ca> is available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see http:

<br>
<br>
Notes for some targets:<br>
<br>
- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt<br>
<br>
- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any 
optimization. With   -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit 
mode (with the -n32   compiler flag). The compiler bug has been 
reported to SGI.<br>
<br>
- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX 
under OSF/1 2.1 it works   when compiled with cc.<br>
<br>
- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the 
cc option -std1 is   necessary to get gzprintf working 
correctly. This is done by configure.<br>
<br>
- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of 
/bin/cc. It works with   other compilers. Use "make test" to check 
your compiler.<br>
<br>
- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac 
compilers.<br>
<br>
- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/<br>
<br>
- When building a shared, i.e. dynamic library on Mac OS X, 
the library must be installed before testing (do "make install" 
before "make test"), since the library location is specified in 
the library.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acknowledgments:<br>

The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. 
The deflate and zlib specifications were written by L. Peter 
Deutsch. Thanks to all the people who reported problems and 
suggested various improvements in zlib; they are too numerous to cite

Derivative Works <br>
     that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, 
and <br>
     attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
     those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
     Works; and<br>
<br>
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its <br>
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that 
do not <br>
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one of <br>
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
     part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form 
or <br>
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if 
and <br>
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not <br>
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an <br>
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such <br>
     additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
     the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions.  
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

The following will be added to the notices file for 
Shrinksafe (and called out <br>
in the DOU for Dojo):<br>
<br>
The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional 
Shrinksafe build <br>
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with 
that tool.  Shrinksafe <br>
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under 
Mozilla Public License <br>
Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has 
been made available at <br>
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.
org.  <br>
<br>
The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or 
higher in order to <br>
run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already 
approved for the Rhino <br>
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed 
with the Shrinksafe <br>
package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 
1.7r2.<br>

contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this License for<br>
that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is

distributed as <br>
 part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents of<br>
 the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do 
not <br>
 modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
 within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an <br>
 addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that

you may have executed with Licensor regarding such 
Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, except <br>
as required for reasonable and customary use in describing 
the origin of the<br>
Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in<br>
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor 
provides its <br>
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF ANY <br>
KIND, either express or implied, including, without 
limitation, any <br>
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, or <br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely 
responsible for determining<br>
the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks<br>
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this

unless required by <br>
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 
acts) or agreed to<br>
in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for 
damages, including <br>
any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential 
damages of any <br>
character arising as a result of this License or out of the 
use or inability<br>
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill,<br>
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and 
all other <br>
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has 
been advised of<br>
the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work<br>
or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and 
charge a fee for, <br>
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other 
liability obligations <br>
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in 
accepting such <br>
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on 
Your sole <br>
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and 
only if You <br>
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any <br>
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by <br>
reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

<br>
Software: <br>
    Jericho 2.6<br>
<br>
<br>
IBM is required to provide you, as the recipient of above 
software, with a <br>
copy of the following license.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0<br>
<br>
1. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
"Contribution" means:<br>
<br>
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code 
and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
<br>
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
<br>
i) changes to the Program, and<br>
<br>
ii) additions to the Program;<br>
<br>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program 
originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A 
Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the 
Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such 
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the 
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and 
(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br>
<br>
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes 
the Program.<br>
<br>
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a 
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its 
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance 
with this Agreement.<br>
<br>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under 
this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br>
<br>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly 
display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the 
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in 
source code and object code form.<br>
<br>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to 
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent 
license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the 
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the 
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination 
to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license 
shall not apply to any other combinations which include the 
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor 
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no 
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not 
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any 
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to 
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on 
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a 
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any 
other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, 
if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient 
to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to 
acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has 
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the 
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in 
object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br>
<br>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement; and<br>
<br>
b) its license agreement:<br>
<br>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all 
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties 
or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied 
warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose;<br>
<br>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all 
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, 
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
<br>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this 
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other 
party; and<br>
<br>
iv) states that source code for the Program is available 
from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in 
a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used 
for software exchange.<br>
<br>
When the Program is made available in source code form:<br>
<br>
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
<br>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy 
of the Program.<br>
<br>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices 
contained within the Program.<br>
<br>
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of 
its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows 
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br>
<br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. 
While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and 
indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against 
any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third 
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by 
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in 
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to 
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged 
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified 
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in 
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to 
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the 
defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified 
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a 
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a 
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes 
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those 
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would 
have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to 
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires 
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br>
<br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE 
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT

MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is 
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated 
with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but 
not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs

<br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER 
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY 
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED 
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT

7. GENERAL<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or 
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and 
without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall 
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any 
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the 
Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's 
patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2
(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate 
if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or 
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a 
reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. 
If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon 
as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations 
under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this 
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is 
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The 
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions 
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one 
other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. 
The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve 
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each 
new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing 
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be 
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was 
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is 
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including 
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly 
stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no 
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel 
or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted 
under this Agreement are reserved.<br>

arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any 
resulting litigation.<br>

<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
<br>
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make<br>
available in Executable form must also be made available in<br>
Source Code form and that Source Code form must be<br>
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must<br>
include a copy of this License with every copy of the<br>
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or<br>
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any<br>
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can<br>
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a<br>
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used<br>
for software exchange.<br>
<br>
3.2. Modifications.<br>
<br>
The Modifications that You create or to which You<br>
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You<br>
represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your<br>
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to<br>
grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br>
<br>
3.3. Required Notices.<br>
<br>
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications<br>
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.<br>
You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or<br>
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or<br>
any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving<br>
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.<br>
<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered<br>
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the<br>
applicable version of this License or the recipients'<br>
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a<br>
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.<br>
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You<br>
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,<br>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by<br>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br>
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
<br>
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered<br>
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms<br>
of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms<br>
different from this License, provided that You are in<br>
compliance with the terms of this License and that the<br>
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit<br>
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form<br>
from the rights set forth in this License. If You<br>
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a<br>
different license, You must make it absolutely clear that<br>
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You<br>
alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You<br>
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br>
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms<br>
You offer.<br>
<br>
3.6. Larger Works.<br>
<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software<br>
with other code not governed by the terms of this License<br>
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such<br>
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License<br>
are fulfilled for the Covered Software.<br>
<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
4.1. New Versions.<br>
<br>
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and<br>
may publish revised and/or new versions of this License<br>
from time to time. Each version will be given a<br>
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in<br>
Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the<br>
right to modify this License.<br>
<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise<br>
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br>
version of the License under which You originally received<br>
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a<br>
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being<br>
distributed or otherwise made available under any<br>
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and<br>
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br>
version of the License under which You originally received<br>
the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to<br>
use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software<br>
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the<br>
License published by the license steward.<br>
<br>
4.3. Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a<br>
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and<br>
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename<br>
the license and remove any references to the name of the<br>
license steward (except to note that the license differs<br>
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that<br>
the license contains terms which differ from this License.<br>
<br>
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS 
IS"<br>
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED,<br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED<br>
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A 
PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
QUALITY AND<br>
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT 
THE<br>
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST 
OF<br>
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS 
DISCLAIMER OF<br>
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO 
USE OF<br>
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS<br>
DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will<br>
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms<br>
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of<br>
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their<br>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of<br>
this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding<br>
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or<br>
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against<br>
whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")<br>
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the<br>
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor<br>
or the Original Software where the Participant is the<br>
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any<br>
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or<br>
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial<br>
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)<br>
and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this<br>
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant<br>
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration<br>
of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day<br>
period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the<br>
Participant Software against such Participant either<br>
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with<br>
Participant.<br>
<br>
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2<br>
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted<br>
by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination<br>
(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)<br>
shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT<br>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, 
THE<br>
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE<br>
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br>
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK<br>
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL 
OTHER<br>
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE 
BEEN<br>
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF<br>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL<br>
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT<br>
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME 
JURISDICTIONS DO<br>
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY 
NOT<br>
APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is<br>
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
"commercial<br>
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  <br>
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software<br>
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept.<br>
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
227.7202-1<br>
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End 
Users<br>
acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth 
herein.<br>
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and 
supersedes,<br>
any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that 
addresses<br>
Government rights in computer software under this License.<br>
<br>
9. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning 
subject<br>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to 
be<br>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the<br>
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall 
be<br>
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a 
notice<br>
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent<br>
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such<br>
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation<br>
relating to this License shall be subject to the 
jurisdiction of<br>
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified 
in a<br>
notice contained within the Original Software, with the 
losing<br>
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 
court<br>
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The<br>
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the<br>
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law 
or<br>
regulation which provides that the language of a contract 
shall<br>
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this 
License.<br>
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance 
with the<br>
United States export administration regulations (and the 
export<br>
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when 
You use,<br>
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.<br>
<br>
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each 
party is<br>
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or<br>
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this 
License<br>
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to<br>
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. 
Nothing<br>
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any 
admission<br>
of liability.   <br>
