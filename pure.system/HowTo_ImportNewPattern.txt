### Importing new Pattern for GIS_IC5_System_Pattern
#
Description:
In the actual state of pattern development it is important, to follow the instructions for importing new pattern.
While importing new pattern versions over existing pattern/script packages, it may be that packages will not be overwritten with the new versions,
so it may results in inconsistence ....

The best and safest way is:
- Delete the System Pattern itself first, than delete all script-packages and addons, which are part of the pattern.
- Delete or backup Property-File on NFS Server in /nfsshare/pureshare/config/<project-name>/i5pattern.properties
	( this is an important step, while developing the pattern, there are many major changes in this file )
- Delete the IBM Connections Shared Directory!! --> /nfsshare/icdata/<project-name>
- Import the new version pattern....
- Change IP Adresses of NFS Server in all pattern PARTS to YOUR NFS Server. Maybe edit the PROJECTNAME variable....
- Deploy....

Update 1.08.2014: 
We now have implemented the WAS & IC Fix installation. The WAS Fixes are part of the sctipt package, but the IC fixes are outside of the packages.
You have to download the fixes from software account ( riedel )  an place them to the NFS dir: <SHARE>/icfixes/ ....

Update 6.08.2014:
1) There is a new fix available, which replaces one of the former Fix Package. You should download the two fixes from RIEDEL account and place them to the
    <SHARE>/icfixes directory.... The two fixes have to be: 
    5.0.0.0-IC-Multi-IFLO80688.jar
    5.0.0.0-IC-Multi-IFLO80990.jar

2) It is mandatory, if you use two deployments of the "Core" Pattern, that you use two different "PROJECTNAMES", as the IC shared directory will conflicts with
    the first CORE pattern deployment....
