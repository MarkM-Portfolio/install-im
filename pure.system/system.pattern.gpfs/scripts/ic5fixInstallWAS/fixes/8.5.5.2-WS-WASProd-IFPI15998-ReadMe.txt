PROBLEM SUMMARY

USERS AFFECTED:
 All users of EJBDeploy inside IBM
WebSphere Application Server V8.5

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Hanging in the EJB deploy process due
to
a dead lock in JDT.

RECOMMENDATION:
None

An intermitent hang occurs in the EJB deploy proces when
running the EJBDeploy command in WebSphere Application Server
V8.5.5.1. The problem is due to a deadlock in the eclipse
code generator component.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION:                                             
It was determined that the deadlock happened in the eclipse     
generator component. The problem was identified and the         
corresponding .jar file was re-built and added to EJBDeploy.    
                                                                
The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in    
fix pack 8.5.5.3. Please refer to the Recommended Updates
